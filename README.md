# Determinstic AWB-ECA soil biogeochemical model inference conditional on synthetic data.
Stan code for inference of deterministic AWB-ECA soil biogeochemical ODE model parameters conditional on synthetic data generated from the SAWB-ECA-SS stochastic differential equation system. Inference results to serve as comparison to SAWB-ECA-SS SDE model inference.
